						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<p>This online album is made in a hurry and honestly it is not a satisfying 
							work. Still learning how to give Esther a surprise and these days I am too busy
							 with a lot of stuffs. Anyway, the luckiest thing ever happened in my life 
							 was meeting you and falling in love with you and this could be counted as a 
							 new way I have never tried to say love you. Happy Anniversary Esther and please
							 keep making me the luckiest guy in the world!</p>

						<h1>Esther rides a horse!</h1>
						<p>We are in the Mid County Park in Williamsburg Virginia. 
						   It is a warm day and Esther just get rid of her assignments so she could
						    enjoy her last bit of fall break. We try our new selfie stick (a gift 
						    from Oracle) and Esther rides me like that she is riding a horse.</p>
					</div>

						<h1>Of course I am sweeter than that lollipop</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/3.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Photos w/ Mickey!</h1>
						<p>It is late at night and today is the first day of the new year. It is also 
						   our first Disney trip. But Mickey seems not tired at all and that reminds me 
						   the first English name of Esther (in my memory) was "Mickey". It is really fun 
						   to know somebody who has a nickname of "cat" also got an English name of "Mickey".</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/4.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>"♪Esther got a Boy friend!♪"</h1>
						<p>I never know that "Shrek" is produeced by Universal Studio and I don't like it before 
						   and I always mistake the green monster with Hulk. We never expect that the donkey could talk
						   and when we ask Shrek and donkey for a photo, the stupid donkey asks Esther: "Who's the guy with you?"
						   The donkey's tone is wicky and after Esther replies it with "He's my boy friend", the stupid donkey begins
						   to sing in another wicky voice: "♪Esther got a boy friend♪, ♪Esther got a boy friend~!♪"</p>

						<h1>Souvenir de Porto Rico</h1>
						<p>Porto Rico is our third island during the cruise trip. Esther does not like the historic
						   attractions but I still order the fort trip. "Souvenir de Porto Rico" seems to be a song 
						   with a little sad mood in it and when I first heard it, I could feel the sadness when the 
						   players were playing. But after today, I never feel a little bit sorrow and it seems my memory 
						   in Porto Rico is fantastic.</p>
					</div>

						<h1>Sun shine is too strong so I rob Esther of her sunglasses</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/10.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Forts @ Porto Rico and sunglasses is still under my control</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>

						<h1>There is no doubt that PS is used to make Esther look whiter</h1>

						<h1>Master of Selfies, Hogwarts University</h1>

						<h1>Sakura in W&M</h1>

						<h1>Esther's Graduation Commencement</h1>
						<p>Guess who is the photographer? The answer is Molly, who is Esther's Mom...
						   So basically I have just escaped from my finals these days but the test after 
						   the final is even more scaring. If I have to choose, I'd like get an F in 
						   any of my courses rather than get an F from Esther's Mom. Luckily, it seems I pass
						   this test as well!</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/15.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Nice! Both of us get sunglasses!</h1>
						<p>Speaking of Esther's impression of Philly, it must be good weather and blue sky. 
						   Guess why there is a Philadelphia trip? That's because Esther is waiting for her 
						   new car and she could not find attractions in Baltimore any more. I still have no 
						   knowledge of the bridge we are on and the river behind us, but what I am sure is 
						   Esther is using Photoshop again!</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/16.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Philly trip with no joking</h1>
						<p>So what we really know about Philadelphia is the delicious food in China Town, the 
							wonderful City Hall and the plan of God for everyone. Xiaolong and Lanzhou Ramen 
							just give us the feeling of going back to China but the beautiful City Hall and 
							other "exotic" buildings (exotic for us) bring us back. What is really dramatic is 
							in such a city like Philly, we accidentally met Vananesa and her Mom three times 
							in four days.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/17.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Amazing icecream!</h1>
						<p>Now we are in Chicago and after visiting Field Museum and walking in Grant Park, 
							it is time to feed Esther. I know in Chicago there is a special icecream which 
							has different special effects on different people. It is said the main function 
							of this kind of icecream is to enhance the most obvious attribute of a person, so
							 I bought Esther one clone and I could just say, it is amazing! I never see such a 
							 round face Esther and I feel I love her more!</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/18.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Now it's my turn to ride Esther!</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/19.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Cloud Gate @ Chicago</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/20.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Let's go sky diving Esther!</h1>
						<p>After our visit to the top level of the famous sky decker, Esther could not help 
							herself to get excited and when I suggest that we should go sky diving or bungee 
							in the near future, I find that Esther gets even more excited. She keeps telling 
							me that she could not do it and she is afraid but who knows Esther better than me? 
							I know she is just acting like a girl in front of me and there is a macho macho man 
							in her inner heart.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/21.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Stand in front of me, Esther!</h1>
						<p>I begin to recognize that Esther may have a great talent in taking selfies. As a Graduate 
							Candidate major in Selfie, I feel Esther, a Graduate Candidate in PS, could be even smarter 
							than me in taking selfies. I never tell her the special skills to make her face look small. 
							Apparently she learnt and commanded that skill by her own. I am very upset because I could 
							not bear that Esther's face looks smaller than mine so next time I will definetly let her 
							stand in front of me. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/22.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Next Time: Mission Failed...</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/23.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Keep baking, keep baking Esther, HaHa</h1>
						<p>It seems that I could not stop Esther from standing behind me and taking selfies in which 
							her round face looks smaller than my handsome face. So I am working on a Plan B, which is 
							telling Esther to bake and then she would eat more and more desserts and finally, even standing 
							behind me could not save her round face and at that time my victory will come and I will still 
							be the best student major in selfie!</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/24.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Girls in Japanese Animation are really popular!</h1>
						<p>We all know that girls, especially Maho Xiyoujiyo (Magic Girls), in Japanese Animation have 
							round faces. So as a sub-plan for the "Feeding Esther with Desserts" plan, I need to tell her that 
							round faces are the most beautiful face types. So I take Esther to the comic show in Baltimore and
							 I find that she is deeply confused by my sweet words and she has made up her mind to get her face 
							 round. Oh, what a great victory of mine!</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/25.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Finally! Esther with glasses, roundest creature in the world!</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/26.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Doubi story should end with doubi emotions!</h1>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/27.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Life long story</h1>
						<p>If this is a story book recording stories of us, I would try my best to write every 
							interesting and exciting stories into this book. Recently I read an article and I 
							strongly agree with the author's point. Peaceful normal daily life is made up of serveral 
							continously happending miracles, or in other word, there would be so many possibilities that would cause 
							we do not know each other or do not fall in love with each other, but what is happening is we love each 
							other so much and I will cherish this miracle happening till now, and make it a life long miracle story of
							us.</p>
